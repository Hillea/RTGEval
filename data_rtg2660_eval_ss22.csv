The echo in the current lecture hall is really strong and after a long day of work when you're usually tired it is so hard to hear or concentrate on what is said because of the echo. Also, if you need to join remotely, it is basically impossible to follow any discussion because of the echo and sometimes it also makes it hard to hear the speaker. ;4;3;4;3;3;2;4;4;3;3;4;4;4;3;2;2;on the GSLS level it would be nice to have more availability/more spaces for certain courses and or seminars. ;2;1;1;2;4;2;4;;4;4;-1;3;5;Some more availability of the PIs.
